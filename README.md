## About Me

Outside of coding, I’m pretty chill. I enjoy games that reward thinking, strong mechanics, or good storytelling. Music is almost always playing while I work — it helps me focus and sets the mood.

I like learning by building, experimenting, and iterating instead of over-planning. If something feels unnecessarily complicated, I’ll usually try to simplify it.

## How I Think
- I prefer simple solutions that actually work  
- I care a lot about user experience, even for small tools

## About This Repo

This repository is a personal space — a place to experiment, build, and express ideas. It’s not meant to be a tutorial or a boilerplate guide.

If you’re here, you’re probably trying to understand **how I think**, not just what tools I use.
